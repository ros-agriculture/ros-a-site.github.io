The documentation is meant to save the important information we share on Slack. You can contribute to the documentation in two ways:

* If you are a member of the ROS Agriculture GitHub organization, you can click on the "Edit this page" link at the top right of each page to open the source file of that page on GitHub, make changes and submit them. The page will be updated after a couple of minutes.
* If you just want to let the ROS Agriculture team about an issue of suggest a change, you can click on the "Create an Issue" link under the "Edit this page" link to create an issue on GitHub. 

Note that the format to be used for editing the pages is [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
