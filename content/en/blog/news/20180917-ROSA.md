Greetings,

ROS-A is a focused initiative for using ROS in Agriculture.

The goal is to make close loop autonomous farming a reality.

We are working on data collection and agricultural data standards. If you would like to participate in the project we will have a breakout session at ROSCon 2017 to discuss the ROS-A standards.

Follow us online Twitter @ROSAgriculture or signup to join the conversation at [http://rosagriculture.org](http://rosagriculture.org).

Thank you for supporting open source robotics,

Matt Droter
Founder
